# SHARD

A RPG text based game prototype that was made as an assignment for 
oriented systems development class in UFSC( Federal University of Santa Catarina ).
As an interactive history, each player can unravel the adventure uniquely. It has
a variety of items and rooms to discover, even if it's only a proof of concept.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get the current version running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Java runtime](https://www.java.com/en/download/) or any [Java-based IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (NetBeans, Eclipse).

### Installing

First you'll need to clone or download the repository.

To clone you can go to the following directory you want it in, open your console (GitBash on windows)
and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/brunomanarin/ShardRPG.git

```
If everything went right you should see:

```
Cloning into 'ShardRPG'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 1030, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1030/1030), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (459/459), done.
remote: Total 1030 (delta 420), reused 864 (delta 254), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (1030/1030), 670.58 KiB | 146.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (420/420), done.

```

Else you can download it as ZIP by clicking the "clone or download button" in the repository,
you can then extract it to the directory of your liking.


## Running/modifing the code

After you got it all setup, if you wish to play the game you can by
opening up your console(this time it is the shell in windows) in the
folder that the game is in (Shard.jar) and typing the following:

```
java -jar Shard.jar

```

This should get the gaming running.

Alternatively, you can open up Eclipse (or another compatible IDE)
and open up the project. If you're using NetBeans, you may want to import the
project as an Eclipse project, instead of normally.

You should then see the source code and if you run the Main class it should work.

This is what the title screen looks like:

```

Also, if you're using the IDE, feel free to modify the game to your liking. Also useful to see how
it was made.
